Show how each of the following constructions can be regarded as a functor:

\textbf{(a)} \emph{The field of quotients of an integral domain}
\vspace{2mm}

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

Let $IntDom$ be a category with integral domains as objects and \textbf{injective} homomorphisms as arrows; and $Field$ be the category of fields, with arrows obeying ring homomorphism rules. Define:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_o$, the object function sends each integral domain to its corresponding field of quotients. 
	\item $T_f$, the arrow function sends each morphism $f$ in $IntDom$ to the induced morphism $T_f(f) : a/b \longmapsto f(a) / f(b)$. 
\end{itemize}

Since, arrows in $IntDom$ are injective, $b \neq 0 \Longrightarrow f(b) \neq 0$. And:

$ a/b \sim a'/b' \Longrightarrow ab' = a'b \Longrightarrow f(a)f(b') = f(a')f(b) \Longrightarrow f(a)/f(b) \sim f(a')/f(b')$. Therefore, $T_f(f)$ is \textbf{well-defined}. The functor rules 
$T_f(f \circ g) = T_f(f) \circ T_f(g)$ and $T_f(id_o) = id_{T_o(o)}$ are satisfied; hence, the construction is a functor.
