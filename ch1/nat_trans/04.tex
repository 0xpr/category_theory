\underline{Exercise 4}
\vspace{2mm}

For functors $S, T: C \to P$ where $C$ is a category and $P$ a preorder, show that
there is a natural transformation $S \xrightarrow{.} T$ (which is then unique) if and only if
$Sc \leq Tc$ for every object $c \in C$.

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

For all $c \in C$, there is the identity arrow. So, if we draw the commutative diagram with $c' = c$, then for every object we have $Sc \leq Tc$ if there is a natural transformation from $S$ to $T$.

Conversely, if $Sc \leq Tc$ for every $c$, then there will be exactly one arrow from $Sc \to Tc$ for all $c$. Since in a preorder between any two objects there can be at most one arrow, the diagram will commute, and the arrow defined above will be the natural transformation.
