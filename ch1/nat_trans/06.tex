\underline{Exercise 6}
\vspace{2mm}

Let $F$ be a field. Show that the category of all finite-dimensional vector spaces
over $F$ (with morphisms all linear transformations) is equivalent to the category
$Matr_F$ described in ยง2.

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

\begin{itemize}
	\item object function: $V^n \mapsto n$
	\item arrow function: takes $L : V^n \to V^m \mapsto A_{m \times n}$, where the matrix is the transformation matrix.  
\end{itemize}

We can pick the natural transformation to be $V^n \mapsto n$. Since this is a bijection, there is a natural equivalence between the identity functor on the category of vector spaces and $Matr_F$. Hence, both these categories are equivalent.
