\underline{Exercise 7}
\vspace{2mm}

An arrow $f: a \to b$ in a category $C$ is \emph{regular} when there exists an arrow $g: b \to a$
such that $f g f = f$. Show that $f$ is regular if it has either a left or a right inverse,
and prove that every arrow in $Set$ with $a \neq \emptyset$ is regular.

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

\begin{itemize}
	\item If it has a left inverse, then there is an $r$ such that $r \circ f = 1_a$. Choosing $g = r$, we have $f g f = f$
	\item If it has a right inverse, then there is an $r$ such that $f \circ r = 1_b$. Choosing $g = r$, we again have $f g f = f$
\end{itemize}

(will prove 2nd part later)
