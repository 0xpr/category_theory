\underline{Exercise 7}
\vspace{2mm}

An arrow $f: a \to b$ in a category $C$ is \emph{regular} when there exists an arrow $g: b \to a$
such that $f g f = f$. Show that $f$ is regular if it has either a left or a right inverse,
and prove that every arrow in $Set$ with $a \neq \emptyset$ is regular.

\emph{Proof}

\begin{itemize}
	\item If it has a left inverse, then there is an $r$ such that $r \circ f = 1_a$. Choosing $g = r$, we have $f g f = f$
	\item If it has a right inverse, then there is an $r$ such that $f \circ r = 1_b$. Choosing $g = r$, we again have $f g f = f$
\end{itemize}

$g: b \to a$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $g(b) = b$ if $b \notin Im(f)$
    \item If $b \in Im(f)$, then pick any random preimage $a$, and let $g(b) =
        a$.
\end{itemize}

Then, $fgf = f$, and so every arrow in $Set$ is regular when $a \neq \emptyset$.
