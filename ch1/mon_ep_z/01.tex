Find a category with an arrow which is both epi and monic, but not invertible.

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

Let $R$ be a one object category with arrows all differentiable functions from $R$ to itself. Then, consider $x \mapsto x^3$, which is a bijective function, so it is both monic and epi, but is not invertible since $x \mapsto x^{1/3}$ is not differentiable at $0$.
