Prove that the composite of monics is monic, and likewise for epis.

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

$g \circ f$ is monic if $g, f$ are monic. Let $p$ and $q$ be two functions whose codomain is the same as the domain of $g \circ f$. Then, 

$(g \circ f) \circ p = (g \circ f) \circ q$

$\implies g \circ (f \circ p) = g \circ (f \circ q)$

$\implies f \circ p = g \circ q$ (since $g$ is monic)

$\implies p = q$ (since $f$ is monic)

$\implies g \circ f$ is monic.


$g \circ f$ is epi if $g, f$ are epi. Let $p$ and $q$ be 2 functions whose domain is the same as the codomain of $g \circ f$. Then,

$p \circ (g \circ f) = q \circ (g \circ f)$

$\implies (p \circ g) \circ f = (q \circ g) \circ f$

$\implies p \circ g = q \circ g$ (since $f$ is epi)

$\implies p = q$ (since $g$ is epi)

$\implies g \circ f$ is epi.
