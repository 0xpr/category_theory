\underline{Exercise 3}

If a composite $g \circ f$ is monic, so is $f$. Is this true of $g$?

\vspace{2mm}

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

Let's say $f$ is not monic. Then there are functions $x$ and $x'$ not equal, such that:

$f \circ x = f \circ x'$

$\implies (g \circ f) \circ x = (g \circ f) \circ x'$

$\implies x = x'$ ($g \circ f$ is monic)

which is a contradiction. So $f$ is monic. It's not necessarily true for $g$. For example, in $Set$, $g$ has to be injective only in the image of $f$, and outside this set it may not be injective.
