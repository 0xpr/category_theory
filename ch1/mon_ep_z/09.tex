If the functor $T: C \to B$ is faithful and $Tf$ is monic. prove $f$ monic.

\noindent
\emph{Proof}

A functor is faithful if $T: Hom(a, b) \to Hom(T(a), T(b))$ is injective.
Let $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2$ and $T(f)$ is monic.

$\implies T(f) \circ T(g_1) = T(f) \circ T(g_2)$

$\implies T(g_1) = T(g_2)$ (from the monic condition)

$\implies g_1 = g_2$, since $T$ is faithful.
